// This Antler example tests streaming FileData back from a node.

package env

// Run contains a single Test that streams data from /dev/random to illustrate
// how data streaming works.
//
// Because all data is streamed, it's transferred from the child node to the
// root node as the test runs. We have overridden Test: Report to *not* include
// the SavesFiles reporter, so the data is discarded.
//
// While the test runs, you should see CPU used by antler and antler-node for
// transferring the data, but the heap should stay stable. Be careful if you
// comment out the ResultStream config. The data from /dev/random will be
// buffered in the node's heap, and since there is 6.4G of it, you may run
// short on memory. :)
